title: 'Lightweight microservice collaboration using HTTP - Christian Horsdal'
recordingDate: 1532418776
description: "With a microservices arhcitecture system behaviour gets spread out across many, many narrowly focused microservices. Much of the functionality in the system depends on those services collaborating.\nIn this talk I explore different modes of collaboration between microservices, how they compare, which are preferable, and how to keep it all simple. Along the way I will show how to use HTTP for the different types of collaboration and how to use Nancy to implement them on top of ASP.NET Core."
